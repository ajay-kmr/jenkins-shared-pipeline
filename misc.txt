Global Shared Libraries
@Refer {@link https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#global-shared-libraries}
There are several places where Shared Libraries can be defined, depending on the use-case.
Manage Jenkins » Configure System » Global Pipeline Libraries as many libraries as necessary can be configured.

If you see any issue related to git checkout during pipeline creation or shared library creation then:-
1) Go to  Manage Jenkins --> Configure System i.e
    http://localhost:8080/configure
 2) Set Up GitHub Details and test it using button- "Test Connection" over there
 3) Once it is done, go to- "Global Pipeline Libraries" and then:-
        a) configure it proper library name eg buildSingleModuleApplication
        b) Default version can be any branch name eg master
        c) Select "Retrieval method" as "Modern SCM"
        d) Select "Source Code Management" as "GitHub"
        e) Provide the GitHub credentials with username and password
        f) Provide "Owner" as the GitHub user name eg- ajay-kmr
        g) Select the correct Repository from dropdown where this library exist
        h) Click on apply and



****************
Known error/exception handling:-

1)file:/var/jenkins_home/jobs/abc/branches/shared-pipeline-v1/builds/10/libs/
    buildSingleModuleApplication/src/com/example/pipeline/step/PipeLineStep.groovy:
    -1: Unsupported expression for CPS transformation @ line -1, column -1.

    We get this issue when the class i.e PipeLineStep.groovy has groovy's annotation which is not supported
     by Jenkins eg @groovy.transform.ToString, @groovy.lang.Delegate etc

2) If you are unable to run the sh command, then Perhaps you forgot to surround the code with a step that provides this, such as: node
3) If you are unable to resolve the github.com then perhaps you have switched the network (internet).
    Either switchback to the same network at which u have configured your git or re-update your git config.

4) fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /var)
   Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
