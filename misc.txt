Known error/exception handling:-

1)file:/var/jenkins_home/jobs/abc/branches/shared-pipeline-v1/builds/10/libs/
    buildSingleModuleApplication/src/com/example/pipeline/step/PipeLineStep.groovy:
    -1: Unsupported expression for CPS transformation @ line -1, column -1.

    We get this issue when the class i.e PipeLineStep.groovy has groovy's annotation which is not supported
     by Jenkins eg @Tostring, @groovy.lang.Delegate etc
