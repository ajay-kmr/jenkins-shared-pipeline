***** How to setup Personal SMTP server for mailing *****

1) We are going to use a Docker container based mail client named MailDev
2) Configure mail client within our Jenkins to send mail
3)Refer Link:-
        a) https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev
        b) https://danfarrelly.nyc/MailDev/


If you want to use MailDev with Docker, you can
use the "djfarrelly/maildev" image on Docker Hub.
For a guide for usage with Docker, checkout the docs at- https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/blob/master/docs/docker.md

To get MailDev up and running quickly, run a new container using the image.
If you don't have the image on your machine, Docker will pull it.

Let's name it "maildev" and publish the interface on port 1080:

    $ docker pull djfarrelly/maildev

Note 1:- The MailDev webapp run at port 80. So forward port 80 of docker container to 8080 of host machine.
So that the MailDev webapp can be accessed using http://localhost:1080

Note 2:- The MailDev SMATP server run at port 25. So forward port 25 of docker container to some port eg 1025 of host machine.
So that the MailDev SMATP server can be accessed using http://localhost:1025

Note 3:- If the port is not forwarded, it will be exposed by default one.
    $ docker run -p 1080:80 -p 1025:25 --name maildev djfarrelly/maildev

Now the MailDev UI will be running at port 1080 on your virtual machine (or machine if you're running Linux).
For example if your Docker host VM is running at 192.168.99.100,
you can head over to http://192.168.99.100:1080 to visit the interface.

Or if you are directly running in your local linux system without any virtual machine- you can navigate to
http://localhost:1080/

You can see the log to get the details of URL and port of your MailDev WebApp and MailDev SMTP server eg:-
            ajay@ajay-thinkpad-e470:~$ docker run -p 1080:80 -p 1025:25 --name maildev djfarrelly/maildev
            MailDev webapp running at http://0.0.0.0:80 //80 is the docker container port and not the host machine port.
            MailDev SMTP Server running at 0.0.0.0:25 //25 is the docker container port and not the host machine port.

            Note:- While running the command- $ docker run -p 1080:80 -p 1025:25 --name maildev djfarrelly/maildev,
            we forwarded port 80 to 8080 and 25 to 1025 of host machine.

            So while configuring the Jenkins Server, we need to provide following details:-
            SMTP server:- 0.0.0.0  or localhost
            SMTP server port:- 1025
